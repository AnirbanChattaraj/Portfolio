            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>👋 Hello and welcome!

Since curiosity brought you here, feel free to explore my portfolio. You might just discover something interesting—and I’d be glad if you did.

I’m Anirban, a passionate programmer and full-stack developer in the making.

I love turning ideas into functional, real-world applications.

From coding challenges in C and C++ to building sleek web interfaces with JavaScript, React, and Angular, I enjoy learning by doing.

Every project you see here is a step in my journey to master technology and problem-solving.

Scroll through, click around, and don’t hesitate to check out the code behind the projects—yes, I promise it’s readable.

Some projects are experimental, some are polished, but all are crafted with dedication (and lots of coffee ☕).

Think of this portfolio as a peek into my world of creativity, logic, and a bit of playful curiosity.

If something catches your eye, feel free to reach out. I love collaborating, discussing ideas, or just geeking out over tech.

By the time you finish exploring, I hope you’ll know me a little better—not just my work, but my approach and mindset too.

So go ahead… indulge your curiosity. You might learn something, laugh a little, or even get inspired.

Thanks for stopping by. Enjoy the tour!</p>
